Threat Intelligence with Elastic - Minemeld integration with Elasticsearch
Threat intelligence feeds 
knowledge really is a power. Knowing the methods and tools attackers are most likely to use can help you better prepare your cybersecurity architecture.  Threat intelligence feeds can assist in this process by identifying common indicators of compromise (IOC) and recommending necessary steps to prevent attack or infection.
•	Threat intelligence feeds are constantly updating streams of indicators or artifacts derived from a source outside the organization.
•	By comparing threat feeds with internal telemetry, you can automate the production of highly valuable operational intelligence.
•	Selecting the right feeds isn’t enough. You should be constantly monitoring the ROI of feeds to determine their value to your organization.
Threat Intelligence Tool
There are various Threat intelligence tools from various security vendors that climb over each other to address the consumer demand for help with the growing number of threats. Architecting an advanced threat intelligence product/tool hugely simplify the process of combining and prioritizing alerts from multiple sources, as well as providing a wide variety of additional benefits.
Opensource feeds are a very good data source in which you can analyse and have the source of feeds that could be of interest to your environment. 
Minemeld is an open-source application that streamlines the aggregation, enforcement and sharing of threat intelligence.  Work flow 
•	collect and aggregate threat intelligence across public, private and commercial intelligence sources
•	filter, deduplicate and consolidate metadata across all sources
•	Consolidated data is consumed by third party enforcement infrastructure. [Elastic Logstash in our case]
